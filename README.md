<h1>
Integrative analysis of 115 transcriptomic studies decodes the molecular landscape of neurodevelopmental disorders
</h1>
We combined 151 RNA sequencing data from 115 independent neurodevelopmental disorder studies to identify common, disease-specific, and phenotype-specific transcriptomic alterations. 
This repository includes the R scripts used for the integration and analysis of the datasets.
